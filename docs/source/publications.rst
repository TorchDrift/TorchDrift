Publications and Talks
======================

Check out our `TorchDrift poster <_static/pdf/torchdrift-pytorch-ecosystem-day-2021-poster.pdf>`_ at the PyTorch Ecosystem Day 2021. The presentation was not recorded.

Thomas talks about TorchDrift in the first episode of the `PyTorch Community Voices podcast, available on Youtube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV5BhoKILoE>`_. (The presentation is similar to that of the PyTorch Ecosystem Day one.)
